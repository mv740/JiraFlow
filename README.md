# jiraMobile

JiraFlow is a mobile app that provides a great experience for your Attassian's Jira.

I build this app because I was tired of being required to go on the web client just to get updates on my issues. During the developement, I got to learn many new android libraries.    

##Features
* View Compagny activity stream
* Comment on task
* Create issues
* Access your sprint dashboard
* Drag and drop your issue in your sprint board
